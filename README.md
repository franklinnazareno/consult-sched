A project around 2022 as required by a course entitled "Software Design".

Tools and technologies used:
* Front-end: React
* Back-end: Node / Express (Server-side), MongoDB (Database).

I (franklinnazareno) contributed mostly in the backend, while the rest of the contributors worked mostly in the front-end.

Client-side of the application is still up at consult-sched.vercel.app although the free hosting for the server-side has been expired.
